This kata was very satisfaing. I came uo with basic concept - which is using recourse multipling and dictionary structure with power as keys, and coefficients as values. After that I just wrote 4 funcions and - thats it. There were some difficulties with expration to dict and dict to expression functions, I think I culd find more elegant solution for them, plus there were exceptions case for 1/-1 coefficients and 0/1 powers, but after all, I could manage all the exception cases, and comleted the task.
