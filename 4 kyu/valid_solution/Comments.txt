I like sudoku, so I had a preaty fast solution idea: if board only contains, by task, integers from 0 to 9, and size is always 9 X 9, I need to:
1. determine if there are '0' in input, return False if there is
2. Check all the verticals, horisontals ans boxes if it contains all the different numbers; sets are good for it.
The hardest part was to transform inintial input into boxes, but once I got the formula - it was easy.S
